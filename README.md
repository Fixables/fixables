# Hi there, I'm Andy 👋

I'm an Electrical Engineering student with a strong hands-on background in electronics, embedded systems, and data-driven problem solving. I enjoy building things that actually work in the real world — whether that’s firmware on a microcontroller, a control system for a robot, or a data pipeline that tells a meaningful story.

I’m particularly interested in the intersection of **hardware, software, and data**, where theory meets solder smoke (the good kind).

## 🎓 Education

**Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) — Electrical Engineering**  
University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver  
*Currently in my 3rd year*

---

## 🏅 Scholarships & Awards

- **Full-Ride International Scholarship (Indonesia)**  
- **Dean’s Honour List** (multiple terms)  
- Additional merit-based academic awards

These supported my studies and allowed me to focus heavily on technical projects, research, and extracurricular engineering work.

## 🔧 Background & Experience

I’ve been involved in **hands-on electronics work since a young age**, helping in my family’s electronics workshop with tasks such as:
- Soldering (SMD & through-hole)
- Circuit troubleshooting and repair
- Component-level diagnostics
- Customer-facing technical support

At university, this evolved into:
- Robotics and embedded systems projects
- PCB design and simulation
- Firmware development
- Data analysis for engineering systems
