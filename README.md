# Andy Setiawan

Hi, I’m **Andy Setiawan**, originally from **Bali, Indonesia**. I love the outdoors (hiking, nature, exploring new places), but I’m equally obsessed with building things, especially **electronics, PCB design, control systems, and robotics**.

Back home, my family runs a small electronics shop, and that’s where I learned a lot of my fundamentals early on, like **soldering (SMT/THT), testing with basic instruments, debugging, electronic repairs, and modifications**. That hands-on start still shapes how I approach engineering today: measure, diagnose, improve, repeat.
