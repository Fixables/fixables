# Andy Setiawan 👋

Hi, I’m **Andy Setiawan**, originally from **Bali, Indonesia** 🌴. I love the outdoors (hiking, nature, exploring new places) 🥾⛰️, but I’m equally obsessed with building things, especially **electronics, PCB design, control systems, and robotics** ⚡🧠🤖.

Back home, my family runs a small electronics shop, and that’s where I learned a lot of my fundamentals early on, like **soldering (SMT/THT), testing with basic instruments, debugging, electronic repairs, and modifications**. That hands-on start still shapes how I approach engineering today: measure, diagnose, improve, repeat.
